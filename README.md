## How to Use This Course

Follow this step-by-step learning flow for each level:

### Step 1: Set Up Your Database
1. Navigate to the `database/` folder
2. Follow the setup instructions in `database/README.md`
3. Run the `setup.sql` script to create the practice database

### Step 2: Read the Lessons
1. Start with the first lesson in the level (e.g., `lesson-01-introduction.md`)
2. Read through all lessons in the level sequentially
3. Type out and run the example queries yourself
4. Experiment with modifying the examples to deepen understanding

### Step 3: Attempt the Exercises
1. Open the exercises file (e.g., `exercises-01.md`)
2. **Write your own SQL solutions** for each exercise
3. Test your solutions by running them against the database
4. Verify your results match the expected output format

### Step 4: Debug and Iterate
1. If a query doesn't work, read the error message carefully
2. Review the relevant lesson sections
3. Check the hints in the exercises file (only if you're stuck)
4. Refine your solution until it works correctly

### Step 5: Move Forward
1. Once you've completed all exercises in a level, move to the next level
2. Don't skip exercises - they're essential for building skills
3. Revisit previous lessons if you need a refresher

## Learning Tips

- **Start simple**: Begin with Level 1 and progress sequentially - each level builds on previous concepts
- **Practice actively**: Don't just read - write and run every query yourself
- **Use hints wisely**: Only check hints when you're genuinely stuck, not as a first resort
- **Test incrementally**: Build queries step by step, testing as you go
- **Review when needed**: Return to previous lessons if concepts need reinforcement
- **Build projects**: Apply learned concepts to real-world scenarios outside the exercises
- **Be patient**: Mastery comes through practice - don't rush through exercises

## Getting Started

1. **Read the Learning Guide**: Start with `LEARNING-GUIDE.md` for complete instructions on:
   - How to set up PostgreSQL (recommended) or SQLite
   - Where to save your solutions
   - How to run SQL queries in your IDE
   - How to validate your answers
2. **Set up PostgreSQL**: Install PostgreSQL and create the database using `database/README.md`
3. **Set up the database**: Run `database/setup.sql` to create tables and sample data
4. **Start with Level 1**: Begin with `level-01-fundamentals/lesson-01-introduction.md`
5. **Follow the flow**: Read lessons → Attempt exercises → Test solutions → Iterate → Next level

## Prerequisites

- No prior SQL knowledge required
- **PostgreSQL** (Recommended - full feature support) or SQLite (simpler alternative)
